Hello all! My name is Omar Gabr and I am an undergraduate mathematics student interested in programming.
I also minor in Physics where I took classes that required programming in Python and simulating physical environments.


I'm interested in pursuing a career in quantitative finance, but I am also open to becoming a freelance software developer.
I'm relatively new to coding. My first time coding was around Summer 2020. I've had huge gaps  but I'm quickly realizing my passion for it.


I'm currently learning GUI applications in C++, as well as learning as many popular libraries such as Boost and STL.
Additonally, I am also learning Python in some of my mathematics and physics courses that implement mathematical applications.


I'm looking to collaborate with anyone who is willing to share feedback to my projects, or simply wanting to discuss the C++ or Python languages.
My repository wil contain an array of different scaled projects that I work on from time to time.


Feel free to reach me using any of my contact information on my profile! I look forward to speaking to any of you!
