Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Omar Gabr and I am a graduate student studying data science and engineering. This profile showcases my journey exploring the practical applications of machine learning algorithms and data engineering practices through inspired projects and datasets.

As a machine learning enthusiast, I am interested in pursuing a career in data science, but I am also open to conducting research in improving machine learning algorithms in Big Data analytic tool and find improved solutions to some of the challenges facing Big Data.

I began my coding journey in 2016 with Python and later expanded my skills to include C++. Now, I code data science projects mainly using Python, and integrate many machine learning frameworks and database management systems to my work. I hope to soon work with Big Data analytical tools and perform advanced analyses with popular cloud platforms like Azure.

Additionally, I also code R for statistical analyses and model planning.
