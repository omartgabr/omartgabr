# Welcome to Omar's GitHub Profile!

My name is Omar Gabr and I have a passion for _quantitative_ and _computational finance_.

I received a B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in Physics from CUNY Baruch College in May 2022 and a M.S. in Data Science and Engineering from CUNY City College of New York in January 2025.

This profile showcases my project work at the intersection of quantitative finance, data science, and machine learning.

**I am currently searching for jobs as a data or product analyst**.
