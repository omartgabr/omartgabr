Welcome!

My name is Omar Gabr and I am an undergraduate senior mathematics student interested in programming and financial mathematics.
I also minor in Physics where I took courses involving coding and simulating physical environments.

I'm interested in pursuing a career in quantitative finance, and currently applying to MFE/MQF degree programs. I hope to
build my current skillset in becoming a quantitative developer upon graduation.

I started coding about 3 years ago in Python, and slowly worked my way towards C++. Now, I practice both and will soon learn
to start integrating them in the same program. I also have been practicing R and SQL, but just a little less than the former two.

I'm currently learning design patterns and advanced functionality in C++11/14/17 by building projects that can be found in my C++
and Python repositories.

I'm looking to collaborate with anyone who is willing to share feedback to my projects, or simply wanting to discuss the C++ or Python languages.
My repository wil contain an array of different scaled projects that I work on from time to time.


Feel free to reach me using any of my contact information on my profile! I look forward to speaking to any of you!
