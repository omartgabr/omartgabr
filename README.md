Hello all! My name is Omar Gabr and I am an undergraduate mathematics student interested in programming and financial mathematics.
I also minor in Physics where I took classes that requires programming in Python and simulating physical environments.


I'm interested in pursuing a career in quantitative finance, but I am also open to becoming a freelance software developer.
I have been practicing programming for about 2 years now and can write code in Python and C++, and also know SQL and VBA.


I'm currently learning GUI applications in C++, as well as many popular libraries such as Boost and STL.
Additonally, I am also learning Python in some of my mathematics and physics courses that implement mathematical applications.

I'm looking to collaborate with anyone who is willing to share feedback to my projects, or simply wanting to discuss the C++ or Python languages.
My repository wil contain an array of different scaled projects that I work on from time to time.


Feel free to reach me using any of my contact information on my profile! I look forward to speaking to any of you!
