# Welcome to Omar's GitHub Profile!

My name is Omar Gabr and I have a passion for _quantitative_ and _computational finance_.

I received my B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in Physics from CUNY Baruch College in May 2022 and my M.S. in Data Science and Engineering from CUNY City College of New York in January 2025.

This profile showcases my project work at the intersection of quantitative finance, data science, and machine learning.

**I am actively searching for jobs**, so if you're a recruiter seeking a self-starter who thrives on new challenges, collaborates efficiently with either individuals or teams, and delivers measurable results, then we should connect!
