# Welcome!

My name is Omar Gabr and some of the things I enjoy doing are coding in C++, learning about options trading, and finding ways to launch my own products.

I received a B.S. in Mathematics from CUNY Baruch College in May 2022, and a M.S. in Data Science and Engineering from CUNY City College of New York in January 2025.

This profile showcases my projects including coding low -atency programs, analytical pipelines, and machine learning systems such as computer vision models.


I am always looking to connect with people interested in data, engineering, or quantitative research, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work.
