Welcome!

My name is Omar Gabr and I am a graduate student studying data science and engineering.
This profile exhibits my journey exploring the practical applications of machine learning algorithms and data engineering practices.

I'm interested in pursuing a career in data science, but I am also open to doing research in improving machine learning algorithms such as
dimensionality reduction techniques or deep learning.

I started my coding journey in 2016 with Python, and slowly worked my way towards C++ just a few months later. Now, I code using both, and hope to soon learn
to start integrating them. Additionally, I also code with R for statistical analyses and SQL for database management.

I'm looking to collaborate with anyone who is willing to share feedback to my projects, or simply wanting to discuss the C++ or Python languages.
My repository wil contain an array of different scaled projects that I work on from time to time.


Feel free to reach me using any of my contact information on my profile! I look forward to speaking to any of you!
